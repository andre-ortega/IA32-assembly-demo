# IA-32 Assembly Language Final

This was the sixth and final project for my assembly language course, which I found very 
instructive. I received full credit for this assignment as well as one of the highest marks 
in the course.

This program will take ten integers and display the sum and average, 
expanding normally trivial single-line operation into a 300 line 
assembly language program.

This was written in Visual Studio with an IA-32 assembly language setup configuration.
